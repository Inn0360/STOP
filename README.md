**Automatic Solar Tracker - Based on Keplerian Theory**

Authors: Alice, Howin, Yuhui, Tatiana


The Automatic Solar Tracker uses the Keplerian Theory of planetary motion in order to calculate and locate the position of the sun based on its latitude and longitude. This will allow a solar panel to maximise its efficency through out the day

Features:
- Automatic longitude and latitude recognition from IP address
- Contains code to control two stepper motors for both Azimuth and Altitude Angle
- Contains files to generate 3D printed case
- Contains custom PCB for stepper motor driver chips commonly found in Arduino Kits
